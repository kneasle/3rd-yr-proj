# Build Branch

**This branch is not for human consumption - all code changes should go to the
[master branch](https://github.com/kneasle/jigsaw) instead.**

This branch contains several built copies of this repository, and are hosted on my website
automatically.  The different versions are as follows:
- `firehose`: Always tracks the latest commit made to the `master` branch.  Always has the very
  latest features, but might be unstable.
- `beta`: Latest beta release version.  This will contain new and mostly polished features that
  aren't yet ready for a full release.
- `stable`: The latest stable/non-beta release version.  This prioritises stability over new
  features, and should be used in production.
